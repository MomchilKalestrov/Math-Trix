### Generating a game board
When you open the game, you will be met with a mostly empty window with a buttom in the bottom left corner. Click it and another window will open, where you can set the size of the board, choose the colors of the players and select (if you want) to play against the CPU (Bot). After you have given your preferences, press the "Submit" button in the bottom to generate a playing field.

### Navigating the playing field
You will see P1 (player 1) on the top left corner and P2 (player 2) on the bottom right corner and math operations in every other cell. You can move only into neighbouring cell (including diagonally) by clicking on them. You cannot move into cells that have already been moved into/ used.  

### How to win
The point of the game is to get the most ammount of points by using the math operations in the cells. The game ends when either player has no cells to move into.
